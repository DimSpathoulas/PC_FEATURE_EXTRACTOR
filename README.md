# Point Cloud Feature extraction based on detections
Part of my master thesis: 
**Probabilistic 3D Multi-Modal Multi-Object Tracking Using Machine Learning and Analytic Collision Risk Calculation for Autonomous Navigation.**


This module is dedicated to extracting 3d detections and their representing point cloud features based on a pre-trained centerpoint detector
